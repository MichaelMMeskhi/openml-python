 3. Number of Instances:  1000
 
 Two datasets are provided.  the original dataset, in the form provided
 by Prof. Hofmann, contains categorical/symbolic attributes and
 is in the file &quot;german.data&quot;.   
  
 For algorithms that need numerical attributes, Strathclyde University 
 produced the file &quot;german.data-numeric&quot;.  This file has been edited 
 and several indicator variables added to make it suitable for 
 algorithms which cannot cope with categorical variables.   Several
 attributes that are ordered categorical (such as attribute 17) have
 been coded as integer.    This was the form used by StatLog.
 
 
 6. Number of Attributes german: 20 (7 numerical, 13 categorical)
    Number of Attributes german.numer: 24 (24 numerical)

 8.  Cost Matrix
 
 This dataset requires use of a cost matrix (see below)
 
 
       1        2
 ----------------------------
   1   0        1
 -----------------------
   2   5        0
 
 (1 = Good,  2 = Bad)
 
 the rows represent the actual classification and the columns
 the predicted classification.
 
 It is worse to class a customer as good when they are bad (5), 
 than it is to class a customer as bad when they are good (1).
